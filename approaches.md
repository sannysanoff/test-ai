==========
(FROM qwen max)
You're facing a **graph reconstruction problem from random walk observations**, where:

- The graph has `N` **hexagonal rooms** (nodes), each with 6 doors (edges labeled 0–5).
- Each room has a **2-bit label** (0, 1, 2, or 3), and you observe these labels along walks.
- You start from a **fixed starting room**.
- You're given **multiple long walks** (e.g., `0(0)3(0)3(5)2(1)2(1)3(4)2(0)1(4)3(1)2(4)3(5)`) — each walk is a sequence of `(door, label)` pairs.
- Goal: Reconstruct the **full undirected graph** (room labels + door-to-door connections) that is **consistent with all observations**.

---

NB: Additional spec: graph is logically undirected: edges with source/target ports are undirected, just ports differ.
This boils down to: number of passages edges from  one room equal to number of passages to that room (same passages, different ports/doors)
Self-linking to same door, or different doors of same room is allowed.

## ❗ Why SMT/CP is too slow

You’re right — modeling this as a constraint satisfaction problem over 30 nodes with 90 undirected edges (180 directed door connections) and label assignments explodes combinatorially. Even with symmetry breaking, the search space is enormous, and observations impose complex *sequential path constraints* that are expensive to encode.

---

## ✅ Recommended Approach: **Incremental Graph Reconstruction with State Merging (like Angluin’s L* or DFA learning, adapted to graphs)**

This is essentially a **passive automata learning** problem, where:

- States = rooms (unknown number, but bounded — you know N from problem size).
- Transitions = door numbers (0–5).
- Output = room label (0–3).

You’re given **traces** (walks) of (input, output) = (door taken, label seen).

You want to build a **Moore machine** (state = room, output = label, transitions = doors) that is **deterministic, complete (6 doors per room), and consistent with all traces**.

---

## 🧠 Step-by-Step Strategy

### STEP 1: Build an **Observation Trie (Prefix Tree)**

Parse all your walks into a trie where:

- Each node = a **state** you *think* you’re in after following a path from start.
- Node stores: the **label observed** at that point.
- Edges = door taken to get to next node.

Example for walk `"0(0)3(0)3(5)"`:

```
Root (start) --0--> NodeA(label=0) --3--> NodeB(label=0) --3--> NodeC(label=5)
```

After processing all walks, you’ll have a tree with possibly **many nodes** — but many may represent the *same actual room*.

> 💡 This is your “hypothesis space” before merging.

---

### STEP 2: **State Merging — Find Equivalent Nodes**

Two nodes in the trie are candidates for merging if:

1. They have the **same label**.
2. For every door (0–5), if both nodes have an outgoing edge via that door, the **target nodes must also be mergeable** (recursively).
3. If one has an edge and the other doesn’t, you can still merge — but you’ll need to *complete* the graph later.

This is similar to **DFA minimization** or **L* learning’s observation table consistency**.

> 🚫 Don’t merge nodes with different labels — constraint says labels are observed and fixed per room.

Use **Union-Find (Disjoint Set Union)** to manage merging.

Algorithm sketch:

```python
for each pair of nodes (u, v) with same label:
    if are_consistent(u, v):
        merge(u, v)

def are_consistent(u, v):
    for door in 0..5:
        u_next = u.transition(door)
        v_next = v.transition(door)
        if u_next and v_next:
            if not (find(u_next) == find(v_next)):  # already merged?
                if not are_consistent(u_next, v_next):  # recursively check
                    return False
        # if only one has transition, it's ok — we'll complete later
    return True
```

After merging, you get a **quotient graph** — your candidate rooms.

---

### STEP 3: **Complete the Graph**

Each room (merged node) must have **exactly 6 doors** (0–5). But your observations may not cover all doors.

For each room and each door 0–5:

- If no transition observed → create a **new unique room** (with unknown label for now) and connect it.
- But wait — you know total number of rooms `N`! So you can’t just keep creating.

> 💡 Use the constraint: **“labels are distributed uniformly, max ceil(N/4) per label”** + “possibly more 1s than 0s”.

So:

- Count how many rooms you have after merging.
- Let `M` = number of rooms in your quotient graph.
- You need to add `N - M` new rooms.

Assign labels to new rooms respecting the distribution constraint.

Then, for missing door transitions, connect to either:

- Existing rooms (if consistent — i.e., if connecting door `d` of room A to room B, then room B must have a door that connects back to A — but since graph is undirected, you just need to ensure the reverse connection is also added or will be consistent).

> 🔄 Since the graph is **undirected**, if room A door 2 → room B, then room B must have *some* door that → room A. You don’t know which — so you have to **guess and verify** or **constrain**.

---

### STEP 4: **Constraint Propagation + Backtracking (Lightweight)**

At this point, you have:

- A partial graph with `M` rooms (from merging).
- `N - M` rooms to add.
- Some door connections missing.
- Label counts must satisfy global constraints.

Now do **light backtracking**:

- For each missing door in each room, try connecting to:
  - Existing rooms (if reverse connection is also missing or can be assigned consistently).
  - New rooms (if you haven’t used all `N - M`).

Use forward checking:

- When you assign a connection A.d → B, enforce that B must eventually have some door e such that B.e → A.
- Maintain label counts — don’t exceed ceil(N/4) per label.

This is **MUCH smaller** than modeling the entire graph from scratch — you’re only assigning the *missing* edges and labels.

---

### STEP 5: **Validation via Walk Replay**

Once you have a candidate full graph:

- Simulate all your observed walks from the start room.
- Check that the sequence of labels matches exactly.

If not → backtrack or adjust merging.

> 💡 You can also generate *discriminating queries* — short walks that would differentiate between ambiguous merges — but since you’re in passive observation mode, you may not be able to query interactively. (But the protocol allows multiple `/explore` — so if allowed, use active learning!)

---

## 🚀 Optimization Tips

### 1. **Start Small — Incremental Learning**

Don’t process all walks at once. Start with short walks, build initial graph, then extend with longer walks and refine merges.

### 2. **Prioritize High-Frequency Paths**

Paths that appear often are more reliable — use them to anchor your merges.

### 3. **Use Label Statistics Early**

If you’ve seen 8 rooms labeled “1” and N=30, and ceil(30/4)=8 → you can’t have any more rooms labeled “1”. Use this to prune merges or assignments.

### 4. **Graph Canonicalization**

After building candidate graph, convert to canonical form (e.g., sort rooms by BFS order from start, relabel doors consistently) to avoid submitting isomorphic duplicates.

---

## 📈 Why This Approach is Efficient

- Observation trie size = total steps in all walks — manageable.
- Merging is O(K^2 * 6) for K trie nodes — K is at most total steps, but after dedup, much smaller.
- Completion only deals with missing edges — not the full Nx6 space.
- Uses problem constraints (label distribution, undirected, fixed N) to prune aggressively.

---

## 🔄 If You CAN Query Actively (Highly Recommended)

The protocol allows submitting multiple route plans per `/explore`. Use this to:

- Submit **discriminating walks** to test hypotheses.
  - E.g., if two merged nodes might be different, find a door sequence that would lead to different labels if they were split.
- Use **binary search** on path space to isolate inconsistencies.
- Greatly reduce ambiguity → less backtracking.

Even 5–10 smart queries can resolve what 100 random walks cannot.

---

## ✅ Summary: Your Best Path Forward

1. **Parse walks → build observation trie.**
2. **Merge consistent nodes (same label + consistent transitions).**
3. **Count rooms → add missing rooms respecting label constraints.**
4. **Complete missing door connections with lightweight backtracking + constraint propagation.**
5. **Validate by replaying all walks.**
6. **(Optional) Use active queries to resolve ambiguity.**

This avoids the combinatorial explosion of CP/SMT by **exploiting the sequential, observation-driven structure** of the problem — exactly what automata learning was designed for.

---

## 🧪 Bonus: Tools/Libraries to Help

- Use `networkx` for graph building/validation.
- Use `unionfind` data structure for merging.
- For active learning, implement a simple discriminator using BFS over your hypothesis graph.

(from GPTPRO)

You can treat your long random‑walk logs as *traces* of a hidden, port‑labeled, 6‑regular, undirected graph whose nodes carry small “colors” (the 2‑bit room labels). Below is a practical, implementation‑ready approach that reconstructs **one complete map** consistent with your observations (and, if you keep probing, converges to the unique map up to equivalence).

---

## 0) Decode what you have

Your sample walk looks like:

```
0(3)2(5)1(1)0
```

Let `o(a)b(a)b` mean:

* `o` origin room (once on start)
* `a` = the **door you choose** in the current room (0–5),
* `b` = **what you observed upon arrival**. Depending on the logger, this could be:

  * **(contest API)**: `b` is the **2‑bit room label** (0–3).

If you have *both* (door you took, arrival door, and the 2‑bit label returned by `/explore`) keep all of them; the more you know, the tighter the reconstruction.

Everything below works in either case; where the two cases differ, I call it out explicitly.

---

## 1) Model

* Rooms form an undirected **port‑labeled** graph: each room has 6 doors, numbered 0–5.
* Each door (a **half‑edge**) is paired with exactly one door of (possibly) the same or another room. Pairing is symmetric. Self‑loops and multi‑edges are allowed (even a door connected to itself).
* Each room has a **label** in {0,1,2,3}. You know the label only when you enter it (the API returns it; your logger may also record it).
* Every walk is a sequence of (chosen door → new room’s observations).

Your task: infer

* number of rooms `N`,
* each room’s label,
* the full pairing of the 6N door‑stubs: for each `(room r, door d)` find `(room r’, door d’)`.

Because some rooms share the same 2‑bit label, many partial reconstructions are possible from limited data. You want **any** map consistent with your logs that is **minimal** (and will pass the contest’s equivalence test).

---

## 2) High‑level approach

Build a big *prefix automaton* from your logs, then **merge** nodes that are behaviorally indistinguishable, respecting all constraints (labels, seen transitions, port symmetry). Finally, close the remaining unobserved door‑stubs with a perfect matching to produce a complete map.

This is essentially “learn a (Mealy/Moore) machine from traces” + “enforce port pairing,” with techniques from DFA state merging and color refinement.

---

## 3) Step‑by‑step

### Step 3.1 — Build the Prefix Tree of Observations (PTA)

* Node = a **prefix** of a walk (including the start `ε`).
* Edge `π ──a──▶ π·a` labeled by the chosen door `a` (0–5).
* Store as attributes on `π·a` what you observed **on arrival** after taking `a`:

  * **Case A**: `arrival_port(π·a) ∈ {0..5}`
  * **Case B**: `label(π·a) ∈ {0..3}`
  * If you have both, store both.
* The PTA shares prefixes across different walks; it’s typically much smaller than the raw logs.

Intuition: each PTA node is a *context* (“what you see after doing this exact sequence from the start”). The true map states are obtained by **merging** contexts that in fact are the same room.

---

### Step 3.2 — Create initial partitions (“colors”)

Give each PTA node an initial **signature**:

```
sig0(π) =
(
  observed_label(π)      // if you have it; else use ⊥
, arrival_port(π)        // if you have it; else use ⊥
)
```

Nodes with different initial signatures can’t be the same room.

---

### Step 3.3 — Refine signatures (Weisfeiler–Lehman style)

Iteratively refine each node’s signature by looking one step deeper through *observed* outgoing doors:

```
sig_{t+1}(π) =
(
  sig_t(π),
  multiset over a in 0..5 of
    [ a , sig_t(child(π, a)), arrival_port(child(π,a)) if known ]
    // if child(π,a) is unseen, put a special value ⊥
)
```

Repeat until signatures stop changing. (This is the 1‑WL/partition‑refinement trick; it’s fast and very effective in practice.)

Now every PTA node has a **behavioral fingerprint** given the data you’ve actually seen.

---

### Step 3.4 — Propose merges

Define **candidate room classes**: nodes with identical final signatures are *eligible* to be merged into a single room.

We don’t merge blindly; we must respect hard constraints:

* **Label consistency:** all nodes merged into one room must have the *same* observed label (if labels are known).
* **Port determinism:** if two contexts are the same room, then for any door `a` that has been tried from both contexts, the arrival observations (Case A: arrival port; Case B: next label sequence) must be consistent.
* **Port symmetry (undirectedness):** every observed step “(room U via door a) → (room V via door b)” implies the reverse must be possible: “(V via door b) → (U via door a)”. If your logs show both directions inconsistently, split the merge.

Do merges with **union‑find** + **conflict checks**; on conflict, roll back the merge and keep the classes separate. The “blue‑fringe” heuristic from DFA inference works well: maintain a fringe of candidates and merge the most similar first.

> **Case A benefit (you have arrival ports):**
> Every observed transition gives you a concrete **port pairing** constraint:
> `(U, a) ↔ (V, b)`.
> Track these pairings while merging; if a merge would assign two different partners to the same `(room,door)`, reject it immediately. This prunes massively.

---

### Step 3.5 — Build the partial map from merged classes

Each equivalence class becomes one **room** in your reconstructed map.

For every observed step in the PTA:

* Let `U = class(parent prefix)`, `a = chosen door`,
* Let `V = class(child prefix)`,
* If you know arrival port `b` (Case A), **fix** the connection `(U,a) ↔ (V,b)`.
* If you only know labels (Case B), record that `(U,a)` connects to **some** door of `V` (unknown which). Keep these as **stubs** with “must‑pair‑into V” constraints.

At this point you’ve placed all edges that your logs concretely determined.

---

### Step 3.6 — Close the remaining doors with a perfect matching

You must end with **every** `(room,door)` paired exactly once.

* Build the set of **free stubs**: door‑slots not yet assigned.
* Allowed partner list for each stub:

  * If your observations fixed its target room `V` (Case B stubs), restrict partners to stubs belonging to `V`.
  * Otherwise, partner can be any other free stub (including same room) not blocked by contradictions you’ve already learned.
* Solve a **perfect matching** on this set:

  * A simple greedy + small backtracking is often enough because degrees are tiny (≤ 6 per room).
  * Prefer pairings that **don’t** create avoidable self‑loops or parallel edges (tie‑breaker).
  * You can add your priors here: e.g., keep label counts close to uniform, and (if you really want) prefer solutions with “more label‑1 than label‑0”.

This step fills in every edge you didn’t actually traverse, yielding a **complete map** that is consistent with everything you observed.

---

### Step 3.7 — Verify against the logs

Simulate every logged walk on the reconstructed map:

* Feed the door sequence; after each step, check that the room’s label (and arrival port if you log it) matches the recorded observation.
* If anything mismatches, backtrack the last few merges or change the matching for free stubs and try again.

When all logs pass, you’ve built a map **indistinguishable** from the real one by any of your observations—exactly the contest’s notion of equivalence.

---

## 4) What you can (and can’t) guarantee

* With enough, diverse walks, the refinement + merge process converges to the **unique** map up to isomorphism of port numbers that preserves all outputs.
* With sparse, purely random walks (especially if you don’t record arrival ports), multiple non‑isomorphic maps may remain consistent. That’s OK for the contest: any equivalent map is accepted.
* If you can still generate more routes, you can **actively disambiguate**:

  **Distinguishing sequences (useful test plans):**

  1. Pick two still‑mergeable classes `U` and `V`. Build a product search to find a short door‑string `w` such that the predicted observations from `U` and `V` differ.
  2. Design two plans that *navigate* from the start to a representative of `U` (resp. `V`) and then append `w`.
  3. Compare the returned sequences; if they differ, split the merge.

  This is classic automata learning: you deliberately query to separate states.

---

## 5) Minimal, concrete data structures

Below is tight pseudocode you can drop into a real program (Python-ish). It assumes **Case A+B** (best case: you logged both arrival ports and labels). If you only have labels (Case B), remove the `arrival_port` checks and rely more on refinement and distinguishing tests.

```python
class PTA:
    # prefix tree
    root = Node(prefix=())
    # map prefix -> node (use a trie in practice)

class Node:
    # Observations upon arrival to this node (empty for root)
    label: Optional[int]          # 0..3 or None
    arr_port: Optional[int]       # 0..5 or None
    children: dict[int, Node]     # door -> child node

# Build PTA
for walk in walks:  # walk = [(door, obs1, [obs2])...]
    node = pta.root
    for step in walk:
        a, obs = step.door, step.arrival_port_or_label
        child = node.children.get(a)
        if not child:
            child = Node()
            node.children[a] = child
        # record observations at child
        if is_case_A:
            child.arr_port = unify(child.arr_port, obs.arr_port)  # must match if already set
        if is_case_B:
            child.label    = unify(child.label,    obs.label)
        node = child

# Color refinement signatures
sig = {node: initial_signature(node)}
changed = True
while changed:
    changed = False
    new_sig = {}
    for node in pta.nodes():
        bucket = []
        for a in range(6):
            c = node.children.get(a)
            bucket.append((
                a,
                sig.get(c, "⊥"),
                getattr(c, 'arr_port', None) if is_case_A else None
            ))
        new_sig[node] = (sig[node], tuple(sorted(bucket)))
        if new_sig[node] != sig[node]:
            changed = True
    sig = new_sig

# Candidate merges: groups = nodes sharing sig
groups = group_by(sig)

# Union-find on groups with constraint checks
UF = UnionFind()
for g in groups:
    for u,v in plausible_pairs_in(g):
        if consistent_to_merge(u,v):   # labels, observed transitions, port pair collisions
            UF.union(u,v)

# Build rooms = UF.classes()
rooms = [Room(representative=rep, label=rep.label) for rep in UF.representatives()]

# Fill observed edges
for node in pta.nodes():
    U = room_of(node.parent)   # parent prefix's class
    for a, child in node.parent.children.items():
        V = room_of(child)
        if is_case_A and child.arr_port is not None:
            set_pair((U,a), (V, child.arr_port))  # hard constraint
        else:
            must_pair_into[(U,a)].add(V)          # soft constraint

# Perfect matching for remaining stubs with backtracking and tie-breakers
solve_matching(stubs, must_pair_into, avoid_self_loops=True, avoid_parallel=True)

# Verify all walks against the constructed map; if fail, backtrack merges/matching as needed.
```

Notes:

* `unify(x,y)` checks consistency (same value if both set).
* `consistent_to_merge(u,v)` additionally simulates all **observed** doors from `u` and `v` and ensures their successors either are already in the same UF class or can be merged without contradiction.
* The perfect matching can be done greedily because each stub has very low degree; if you ever need a full algorithm, Edmonds’ blossom is overkill but fine.

---

## 6) Using your exact sample string

If your parentheses are **arrival ports** (very plausible given 4s and 5s):

```
... 3(5) ...
```

means: from the current room, you took door `3` and arrived at a room **through its door 5**. That immediately yields a hard pairing `(U,3) ↔ (V,5)` for that step. Accumulating these from all walks will quickly nail down most of the map before you even need merging. The remaining unknown doors (never used during the walks) will be finished by the perfect matching in Step 3.6.

If instead parentheses are **room labels** (0–3), just treat them as `label` in the algorithm above. You won’t get the `(U,a) ↔ (V,b)` hard constraints, so the merging/refinement and (optionally) distinguishing tests become more important.

---

## 7) Practical tips & priors

* **Priors on label counts.** The problem text says labels are \~uniform with each label count ≤ ⌈N/4⌉ and “there could be more rooms with label 1 than label 0.” Use this only as a **tie‑breaker** when choosing merges or matchings; never overrule a hard observational constraint.
* **Avoid over‑merging.** It’s safer to keep states separate and let the matching complete the map than to merge two contexts that later contradict. The WL signature usually prevents that.
* **Loops & parallel edges.** They’re legal; don’t forbid them—just de‑prioritize them when multiple matchings fit.

---

## 8) What to hand in / how to use it

Once you have the rooms and all port pairings:

* Build the `map` object the API expects:

  * `rooms`: the label (0–3) of each inferred room,
  * `startingRoom`: the class that contains the PTA root’s child after the **first** step of some fixed walk (or pick any; equivalence doesn’t depend on numeric indices),
  * `connections`: every unique pairing `(from:{room,door}, to:{room,door})`.
    Because the map is undirected, list each pairing once.

Simulate your `plans` locally against this map to be certain your logs match, then submit.

---

### TL;DR

1. Build the **PTA** from your walk logs.
2. Run **signature refinement** to group behaviorally identical contexts.
3. **Merge** groups that pass label/transition/port‑symmetry checks.
4. Use observed steps to **fix port pairings**; finish the rest with a **perfect matching** that respects any “must‑pair‑into” constraints.
5. **Verify** all logs; adjust merges or matching if needed.
6. Output the map; it will be correct up to the contest’s equivalence.

If you want, paste a few of your actual walk logs (even 3–5 long ones), and I’ll run this reconstruction logic on them and show you the concrete `rooms` array and `connections` list you would submit.
